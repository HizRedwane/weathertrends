# weather trends

The project is a case study that gives data about annual averages temperature from different locations or cities all over the world, and global yearly average data temperature. I have to choose the nearest city to my location and try first to analyst its temperature trends over the years, and then compare it to the global temperature trends.

Since I’m from morocco, I looked over city list Table, and I found the two major cities in my country, Rabat the capital and Casablanca. Rabat is an administrative city; it’s big but not as big as Casablanca. The last one, we call it the economic capital of morocco it has a population of about 4 million and lot of industrial zones, so it has a big impact on climate change in comparison to Rabat. For that, my study will be about Casablanca.
